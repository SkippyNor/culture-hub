# play-services

Proof of concept of a services application written with play-scala.

This will eventually demonstrate things such as authentication & authorization, content-type based rendering, etc.

## Getting started

- download the Play framework at http://www.playframework.org/download, unzip it and add the play directory to your path
- install play-scala by running `play install scala-0.9.1`
- from the `play-services` directory, run the application via `play run`
- in order to use the project in IDEA (until there will be plugin support for it), run `play idealize` to generate a module, then create a new project (without module) and import the generated module
